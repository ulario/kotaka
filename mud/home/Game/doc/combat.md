# Combat

This is a basic combat system to allow one character to fight and hopefully kill another.

Combat is done for now as a single IC verb, called "fight", which allows
one living character to attack another with the goal of inflicting enough
damage to kill them by reducing their hp to 0 or below.

Infliction of such fatal damage will result in the fight verb wiping the
target's living lwo, thus rendering it dead.
